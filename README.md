# Obstacle_Detection_System_SIH_2023
IOT Obstacle Detection System – SIH 2023  Developed a prototype under the problem statement for mining safety in low-visibility conditions like fog and rain. 
# 🚧 IOT Obstacle Detection System – IVSMS (SIH 2023)

A smart embedded prototype designed for enhancing vehicle safety in mining operations during low-visibility conditions such as dense fog or heavy rain. This project was built as part of the Smart India Hackathon 2023 under the name **Integrated Vehicle Safety and Monitoring System (IVSMS)**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **C Programming** – Embedded logic and sensor control
- **Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04)** – Real-time obstacle detection
- **Embedded Systems (Microcontroller-based)** – Core hardware integration

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Mining operators often face poor visibility due to weather conditions, leading to accidents with heavy earth-moving machinery. Our goal was to design a **low-cost**, **effective**, and **reliable** system to alert operators of nearby obstacles in such conditions.

## 💡 Solution Overview

- Placed **ultrasonic sensors** at strategic points on the machinery.
- Measured the distance between the machine and nearby objects in real-time.
- Triggered **alerts (buzzer or LED)** when an obstacle was within the danger range.
- Built the prototype with a focus on **quick response**, **accuracy**, and **durability**.

## 🔍 Key Features

- 📏 Real-time distance sensing (up to 3 meters)
- 🚨 Immediate alerts to prevent collisions
- 🌧️ Designed for low-visibility and rugged outdoor environments
- 🔧 Easily mountable on various machinery

## 🚀 Impact

- Improved safety and situational awareness in hazardous mining zones
- Reduced risk of accidents due to human error or poor visibility
- Offered a **cost-effective solution** for government and private mining sectors

## 🏆 Achievements

- **Finalist at Smart India Hackathon 2023**
- Praised for practical innovation and relevance to real-world challenges

## 👨‍💻 Team Contribution

Led sensor integration and embedded system design, ensuring reliable performance during testing in simulated fog/rain conditions.
